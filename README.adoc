= Vulkan1.4 + Dynamic Rendering + Sync2 + Extended Dynamic State

**Update:**
Now that macOS supports Vulkan 1.4, I’ve switched this project over to Vulkan 1.4.

This sample is based on Khronos' sample code Triangle 1.3, but works with Vulkan 1.2 by enabling extensions, and also allows for scene graph display.

The differences from the Khronos sample are as follows:

* Vulkan 1.3 and later versions now run on Vulkan 1.2 + Extension. This means it also works on Mac. The Extension is loaded with volk.
* Modified to use Vk-Bootstrap.
* Modified to use VMA (Vulkan Memory Allocator).
* Added the ability to display arbitrary shapes in the scene by adding nodes.
